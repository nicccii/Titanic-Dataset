# Titanic-Dataset

Assessment Brief:

Participate in Kaggleâ€™s Titanic Machine Learning Competition. The project is to predict whether a passenger will survive a fatal incident. The training dataset is acquired from Kaggle titanic dataset prediction competition and test dataset from the same.

Objectives:

Train the model using one Deep learning algorithm and one traditional machine learning algorithm.

Test the model with the dataset given by kaggle.

Write into a CSV file contain only passenger ID and predicted output and upload it to kaggle.
